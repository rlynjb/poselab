# Next.js Best Practices

## App Router
- Use the App Router (`app/` directory) for new projects
- Organize routes with route groups `(group)` for shared layouts
- Use `layout.tsx` for persistent UI across route segments
- Use `loading.tsx` for route-level loading states
- Use `error.tsx` for route-level error boundaries
- Keep page components thin — delegate to feature components

## Data Fetching
- Fetch data in Server Components by default — no `useEffect` needed
- Use `fetch` with caching options for server-side data
- Deduplicate requests — Next.js automatically dedupes `fetch` calls
- Use `generateStaticParams` for static generation of dynamic routes
- Prefer server-side data fetching over client-side for SEO-critical pages
- Use SWR or TanStack Query for client-side data that needs real-time updates

## API Routes
- Use Route Handlers (`route.ts`) in the App Router
- Validate request bodies before processing
- Return consistent error shapes: `{ error: string }`
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 500)
- Add rate limiting for public endpoints
- Never expose secrets in client-side code

## Performance
- Use `next/image` for automatic image optimization
- Use `next/font` for self-hosted fonts with zero layout shift
- Minimize client-side JavaScript — prefer Server Components
- Use dynamic imports for heavy client-side libraries
- Configure `headers()` for proper cache-control
- Use `generateMetadata` for SEO metadata

## Deployment
- Use environment variables for configuration (`.env.local` for dev)
- Set up CI/CD with automated type-checking and linting
- Configure `output: 'standalone'` for containerized deployments
- Use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for semi-static content
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
- Test with `next build && next start` before deploying

# Node.js Best Practices

## Project Structure
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type (routes, controllers, models)
- Keep entry points thin — delegate to modules
- Use ES modules (`import/export`) over CommonJS (`require`)
- Separate configuration from code — use environment variables
- Use a single `lib/` or `src/` directory for source code
- Keep serverless functions small and focused — one responsibility per function

## Error Handling
- Always handle promise rejections — use try/catch with async/await
- Create custom error classes for domain-specific errors
- Log errors with context (request ID, user ID, operation name)
- Return user-friendly error messages — never expose stack traces
- Use error classification to map internal errors to HTTP status codes
- Implement graceful shutdown for long-running processes

## Security
- Never commit secrets — use environment variables and `.env` files (gitignored)
- Validate and sanitize all user input at system boundaries
- Use parameterized queries — never interpolate user input into SQL/NoSQL queries
- Escape HTML when rendering user-provided content
- Set appropriate CORS headers — restrict origins in production
- Keep dependencies updated — run `npm audit` regularly
- Use helmet.js or equivalent for HTTP security headers

## Performance
- Use streaming for large payloads instead of buffering
- Implement caching at appropriate layers (memory, CDN, database)
- Use connection pooling for database and HTTP connections
- Avoid blocking the event loop — offload CPU-intensive work
- Monitor memory usage — watch for leaks in long-running processes
- Use compression for API responses

## Testing
- Write unit tests for pure business logic
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Use test databases or in-memory stores for isolation
- Mock external services at the HTTP boundary (MSW, nock)
- Test error paths — not just happy paths
- Use code coverage as a guide, not a goal

# React Best Practices

## Component Structure
- Prefer function components with hooks over class components
- Keep components small and focused — one responsibility per component
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Co-locate related files (component, styles, tests) in the same directory
- Use named exports for components (enables better refactoring tooling)
- Separate container/smart components from presentational/dumb components

## State Management
- Use `useState` for local component state
- Use `useReducer` for complex state with multiple sub-values
- Lift state to the nearest common ancestor — avoid prop drilling with Context
- Use React Context for truly global state (theme, auth, locale)
- Avoid putting everything in global state — prefer local state by default
- Derive computed values inline or with `useMemo` — don't store derived state

## Performance
- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`
- Memoize callbacks passed to child components with `useCallback`
- Use `React.memo` for components that render often with the same props
- Avoid creating new objects/arrays in render — stabilize references
- Use lazy loading (`React.lazy` + `Suspense`) for code splitting
- Profile with React DevTools before optimizing — measure, don't guess

## Testing
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Use React Testing Library over Enzyme
- Write integration tests that render components with their context
- Test user interactions: clicks, typing, form submissions
- Mock API calls at the network layer (MSW) not at the module level
- Aim for high confidence, not high coverage

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements (`button`, `nav`, `main`, `section`)
- Add `aria-label` to icon-only buttons and links
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Manage focus when opening/closing modals and dialogs
- Use `role` attributes only when no semantic element exists
- Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

# Tailwind CSS Best Practices

## Configuration
- Extend the default theme rather than overriding it
- Define design tokens (colors, spacing, fonts) in `tailwind.config`
- Use CSS variables for dynamic theming
- Configure `content` paths to include all template files
- Use Tailwind v4's `@theme` directive for inline configuration
- Keep custom utilities minimal — prefer composing existing classes

## Component Patterns
- Extract repeated class combinations into CSS components with `@apply`
- Use BEM naming for extracted CSS classes: `.card`, `.card__title`, `.card--highlighted`
- Co-locate component CSS files with their components
- Prefer utility classes for one-off styling
- Use `@apply` in separate CSS files, not inline styles
- Keep class lists readable — group by category (layout, spacing, color, typography)

## Responsive Design
- Design mobile-first — use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` for larger screens
- Use container queries (`@container`) for component-level responsiveness
- Avoid fixed widths — use `max-w-` constraints instead
- Test at common breakpoints: 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- Use `gap` over margins for flex/grid spacing
- Prefer `grid` for 2D layouts, `flex` for 1D layouts

## Dark Mode
- Use `class` strategy for manual dark mode control
- Define color pairs: light background + dark override
- Use semantic color names: `bg-surface`, `text-primary`
- Test contrast ratios in both modes (WCAG AA minimum)
- Use `prefers-color-scheme` media query as initial default

## Performance
- Enable JIT mode (default in v3+)
- Remove unused CSS with content configuration
- Avoid dynamically constructing class names: `text-${color}-500` won't work
- Use `@reference` in separate CSS files to enable Tailwind v4 `@apply`
- Minimize custom CSS — every custom class is a potential maintenance burden

# TypeScript Best Practices

## Type Safety
- Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json — non-negotiable for new projects
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions and intersections
- Avoid `any` — use `unknown` when the type is truly unknown
- Use `as const` for literal type inference on objects and arrays
- Narrow types with type guards instead of type assertions
- Define return types for public API functions

## Generics
- Use generics when a function works with multiple types but maintains type relationships
- Constrain generics with `extends` to enforce minimum shape
- Prefer fewer generic parameters — complexity grows exponentially
- Name generic parameters descriptively when more than one: `TInput`, `TOutput`
- Use default generic parameters for common cases

## Utility Types
- Use `Partial<T>` for optional updates
- Use `Required<T>` to make all properties mandatory
- Use `Pick<T, K>` and `Omit<T, K>` to derive sub-types
- Use `Record<K, V>` for dictionaries
- Use `ReturnType<T>` to extract return types from functions
- Combine utility types: `Partial<Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>>`

## Project Config
- Enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for safer array/object access
- Enable `noImplicitReturns` to catch missing returns
- Enable `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` for precise optional handling
- Use path aliases (`@/`) for clean imports
- Keep `lib` and `target` aligned with your runtime
- Use project references for monorepo setups

## Common Patterns
- Use discriminated unions for state machines and variants
- Prefer `readonly` arrays and properties for immutable data
- Use template literal types for string patterns
- Define error types and use `Result<T, E>` pattern for fallible operations
- Export types alongside their implementations
- Use `satisfies` operator for type checking without widening
